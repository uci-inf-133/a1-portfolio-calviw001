--Readme document for Calvin Wong, calviw8@uci.edu--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
I added one image showing a picture of myself on the home page. There are links to my resume, Linkedin, GitHub, and social media
platforms. These links are accessed by clicking on custom icons I got from Font Awesome. Three html pages were created and can
be navigated using a navigation bar. 


(b) CSS features
Custom fonts were used and taken from Google Fonts to add more flair. Palleton helped me create an appealing colot scheme
for a website. I utilized boostrap in my webstie so that the elements on screen would change in size and position based on 
screen size. I adjusted the padding and margins of every element, so that each element was visible and no obscuring one another.


(c) Advanced features
I embedded videos that both showcase a demo of one of my projects in the projects section of my website. I added a contact me
section with a contact form to allow users to send me a message to my email. It doesn't actually work, but it does accept the user's 
name, email, and a message to me. Once a message is sent, a popup appears letting the user believe their message was sent. I even
added a dark mode feature to my website that is toggled by pressing a button in the navigation bar.


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
I had no warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
It took me around 15 hours to complete this assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
I used various youtube videos and other resources on the internet to help me complete certain features. Some of these resources are
included below:
    - Contact form with boostrap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmfqZGH7DKE
    - Semantic tags: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
    - Bootstrap tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp
    - Popup with JS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_PL0K2fGkY
    - Add video to website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECM-OIYbQSY


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
I got help from the TAs as well as the professor. I asked Weijun, Ziqi, and the professor to review my website and identity
if it embrances the spirit of the assignment. Weijun was the one who suggested I create a contact form in my contact me page. 
Before, the contact me page only listed my email and social media links, but the ass contact form definitely made the page 
a lot better. The professor's lectures about HTML, CSS, and JS were invaluable as well.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I don't think so.
